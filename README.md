# RSV Disparities Among Pregnant Women

## Research Question
* Are there specific racial disparities in weekly RSV vaccination coverage rates among pregnant women?
* At what weeks are these disparities most pronounced?
* What does the weekly RSV vaccination coverage rates in pregnant women of different racial demographics look like over time?
* What does the race/ethnicity distribution look like during this period?

## Objective
This milestone focused on leveraging Python to analyze and visualize data to answer specific research questions. The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of:
    * Data Retrieval and cleaning
    * Data analysis
    * Data visualization

## Research Topic
This work seeks to explore whether or not there are notable differences between pregnant women of varying demographics receiving the RSV vaccine.

## Deliverable
A Jupyter Notebook was created to showcase:
* Data retrieval and cleaning 
* Analytical Insights
* Visualizations (grouped bar chart, line graph, and pie chart)

# Key Findings
* There are notable racial and ethnic differences in RSV vaccination rates among pregnant women.
* Hispanic/Latino women had the highest unvaccinated rates for four consecutive weeks, but they also made up the largest demographic group in the study.
* White women had the second-highest unvaccinated rates and were close behind Hispanic women in the first week.
* Asian and White women consistently had the highest vaccination rates over time, while Black and Hispanic women had the lowest.
* These trends suggest potential disparities, but further analysis is needed to determine if differences are due to unequal access or the demographic makeup of the study population.
